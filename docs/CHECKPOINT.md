# 🍄 Checkpoint - Left Off Here

## Current State
Winter Assistant fully operational with:
- Project-based sculpted memory system
- Multi-file browser with WASD navigation
- Sacred foundation for immutable principles
- Auto-memory sculptor (LLM curates facts)
- Conversation logging (separate from sculpting)

## What's NOT Done Yet
**Conversations are NOT integrated with sculpting system**
- Conversations save full logs to `conversations/*.jsonl`
- They do NOT create sculpted summaries
- They do NOT feed into project memory

## Next Steps
Integrate conversation → checkpoint → sculpture pipeline
