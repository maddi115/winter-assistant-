🍄 Sunset memory sculpting, implement RAG-based conversation retrieval

## What Changed

### 1. Removed Memory Sculpting (Sunset 🌅)
- Memory sculpting was unreliable and slow (~30s per turn)
- Required complex prompt engineering with inconsistent JSON extraction
- Needed Redis fact/state management that wasn't working well
- Required higher-level infrastructure (knowledge graphs, conflict resolution)
  to be truly effective

### 2. Implemented LanceDB Vector Database
**Storage:**
- Every conversation turn embedded as 384-dimensional vector
- Full conversation text + embeddings stored in `lance_db/conversations.lance`
- Fast local embeddings via sentence-transformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)
- Auto-generated 3-word conversation titles

**Files Added:**
- `lancedb_conversation_manager.py` - Core storage with embeddings
- `conversation_selector.py` - UI for selecting/creating conversations
- `lancedb_ui.py` - Menu components
- `lancedb_assistant.py` - Main entry point with RAG
- `test_lancedb.py` - Verification tests

### 3. Implemented RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)
**How it works:**
- AI doesn't read entire conversation history (would be slow/expensive)
- Instead, retrieves only relevant context via hybrid approach:
  - Last 3 turns (recency)
  - 3 semantically similar turns (vector search)
  - Combines, deduplicates, sorts chronologically
- AI sees 3-6 turns max, not 100+

**Benefits:**
- Fast: ~1s embedding vs ~30s sculpting
- Accurate: Semantic search finds relevant context
- Scalable: Works with thousands of turns
- Simple: No complex extraction/validation needed

### 4. Updated winter_core.py
- Added `conversation_history` parameter to `chat()` method
- AI now receives retrieved conversation context
- Memory persists across turns via semantic retrieval

## Why This Approach

**Memory sculpting needed:**
- Reliable entity extraction
- Knowledge graph infrastructure  
- Conflict resolution
- Sophisticated state management
- Works better as offline batch process

**RAG provides:**
- ✅ Searchable conversation history
- ✅ Semantic retrieval of relevant context
- ✅ In-conversation memory via context window
- ✅ Fast, reliable, proven approach
- ✅ Standard solution for LLM memory (used industry-wide)

## Architecture
```
User Query
    ↓
Recent Context (3 turns) + Semantic Search (3 turns)
    ↓
Deduplicate & Sort
    ↓
Pass to AI (3-6 turns max)
    ↓
Generate Response
    ↓
Embed & Store in LanceDB
```

## Usage

**Old system:** `python assistant.py` (JSONL files, memory sculpting)
**New system:** `python lancedb_assistant.py` (RAG with vector search)

**Commands:**
- `history` - View recent turns
- `search <query>` - Semantic search across all conversations
- `memory` - View Redis project memory (still available for projects)
- `quit` - Exit

## Future Considerations

For business/market research use cases, consider adding:
- Graph DB (Neo4j) for entity/relationship tracking
- Entity extraction pipeline
- Hybrid retrieval: Graph structure + Vector semantics

## Dependencies Added

- lancedb==0.26.1
- sentence-transformers==5.2.0
- torch==2.9.1
- pandas==2.3.3
- polars==1.36.1
