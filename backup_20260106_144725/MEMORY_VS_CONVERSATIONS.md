# Memory vs Conversations

## Projects (Memory Sculpting)
- Compressed semantic knowledge
- Facts, states, outcomes with weights
- Persists forever
- Gets smarter over time
- Example: "life_journal", "dev_notes"

## New Conversation (Just Chat)
- Full conversation logs only
- NO memory sculpting
- NO compression
- Just raw chat saved to file
- Use for one-off questions

## Key Difference

**Project**: AI remembers context, builds knowledge graph
**New Conversation**: AI forgets after session, only logs saved
